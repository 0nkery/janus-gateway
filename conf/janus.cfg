; General configuration: folders where the configuration and the plugins
; can be found, default interface to use, debug/logging level and, if
; needed, shared apisecret between application(s) and Janus.
[general]
configs_folder = ./conf		; Configuration files folder
plugins_folder = ./plugins	; Plugins folder
;interface = 1.2.3.4		; Interface to use (will be used in SDP)
debug_level = 4				; Debug/logging level, valid values are 0-7
;apisecret = janusrocks		; String that all Janus requests must contain
;							to be accepted/authorized by the Janus core.
;							Useful if you're wrapping all Janus API requests
;							in your servers (that is, not in the browser,
;							where you do the things your way) and you
;							don't want other application to mess with
;							this Janus instance.

; Web server stuff: whether HTTP or HTTPS need to be enabled, on which
;ports, and what should be the base path for the Janus API protocol.
[webserver]
http = yes
port = 8088					; Web server HTTP port
https = no
;secure_port = 8889			; Web server HTTPS port
base_path = /janus			; Base path to bind to in the web server 

; Certificate and key to use for DTLS and/or HTTPS.
[certificates]
cert_pem = certs/mycert.pem
cert_key = certs/mycert.key

; Media-related stuff: right now, you can only configure the range of
; ports to use for RTP and RTCP (by default, no range is envisaged).
; If you configure a range in the lines below, remember to uncomment the
; [media] category as well!
;[media]
;rtp_port_range = 20000-40000

; NAT-related stuff: specifically, you can either manually specify the 
; public IP of the machine (i.e., what would be used in SDP) or
; configure the STUN server to use to gather candidates if the gateway
; is behind a NAT, and srflx candidates are needed. By default, this
; section is commented as the gateway is assumed to be deployed on a
; public network. When configuring the public IP or the STUN
; configuration, remember to uncomment the [nat] categoty line as well!
[nat]
;public_ip = 1.2.3.4
;stun_server = stun.voip.eutelia.it
;stun_port = 3478

; You can also choose which interfaces or IP addresses should be excluded
; and ignored by the gateway for the purpose of ICE candidates gathering.
; To do so, use the 'ice_ignore_list' setting and pass it a comma-separated
; list of interfaces or IP addresses to ignore. This is especially useful
; if the server hosting the gateway has several interfaces you already
; know will not be used or will simply always slow down ICE (e.g., virtual
; interfaces created by VMware). Partial strings are supported, which
; means that any of the following examples are valid:
;     ice_ignore_list = vmnet8,192.168.0.1,10.0.0.1
;     ice_ignore_list = vmnet,192.168.
; By default, we ignore all interfaces whose name starts with 'vmnet':
ice_ignore_list = vmnet
