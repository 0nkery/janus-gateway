; The only things you configure in here are which lua script to load and,
; optionally, the paths to add for searching libraries. By default, the
; configuration file adds a path to where the Lua samples have been
; installed, as it contains a couple of helper libraries the samples use;
; should you be interested in adding more, just add other paths separated
; by a semicolon. Due to the syntax of the configuration file, make sure
; you escape all semicolons with a trailing slash, in case.
